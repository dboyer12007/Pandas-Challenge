# Pandas-Challenge
When merging data, I used the variable merged_data instead of the school_data_complete variable they used when merging the two files. The rest of the code uses merged_data when refering to the merged data.
At one point there is an instruction to display the first 5 rows of the table with the head() command. I know it can be done as head(5), but I left it as head() as the head command shows 5 by default.
